# NextSecureScan - Next.js-CVE-2025-29927 Middleware Vulnerability Scanner

**NextSecureScan** is a comprehensive security scanner specifically designed to identify middleware-related authorization bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-29927) in Next.js applications. This scanner leverages explicit header manipulation techniques, middleware redirect detection, and advanced polyglot bypass methods to provide thorough vulnerability assessments.

## üõ°Ô∏è Features

- **Middleware Detection**: Explicitly detects Next.js middleware usage through standard and advanced HTTP header checks (`x-middleware-rewrite`, `x-middleware-set-cookie`).
- **Redirect Analysis**: Clearly identifies middleware-induced redirects (HTTP 307) and examines headers (`x-nextjs-redirect`, `x-nextjs-rewrite`) to assess middleware protection explicitly.
- **Polyglot Header Bypass**: Utilizes a polyglot `X-Middleware-Subrequest` header to efficiently test multiple middleware paths simultaneously.
- **Version-Specific Testing**: Explicitly tests middleware configurations known to different Next.js versions.
- **Locale-based Redirect & Cache Poisoning Checks**: Detects potential cache poisoning and denial-of-service scenarios caused by bypassing locale-based redirects.
- **Clear & Structured Console Output**: Provides color-coded, readable console outputs clearly indicating vulnerability findings and middleware protections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 urllib3 colorama
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Scanner

Execute the scanner script and provide the URL of the Next.js application:

```bash
python nextjs_scanner.py
```

Then input the target URL when prompted:

```
Enter target URL (with or without https://): your-app-url.com
```

### Example Output

The scanner will explicitly report findings:

```bash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SCANNING] https://your-app-url.com
[INFO] Middleware redirect detected at https://your-app-url.com. Headers: ['x-nextjs-redirect']
[VULNERABLE] https://your-app-url.com middleware bypassed successfully using middleware.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

- **Blue:** Currently scanning URL
- **Yellow:** Informational messages (middleware headers detected)
- **Green:** Safe results (middleware protection active)
- **Red:** Vulnerabilities explicitly identified
- **Magenta:** Potential cache poisoning or locale-based redirect issues

## üîç Verification and False Positives

Scanner results should be manually verified using tools like **Burp Suite** or browser extensions capable of HTTP header manipulation.

- Confirm baseline middleware behavior explicitly.
- Attempt exploit headers (`X-Middleware-Subrequest`) explicitly to verify bypass potential.
